## Updating the grant summary file

1. The grant summary file is used to create/update the graph included on the primary grant pages - Jails, Justice and Police. 
2. The data for each year is taken from the state budget explorer portals.
3. Overall grant summary file for 2022 can be downloaded from [this link](https://assam2022.openbudgetsindia.org/en/expenditure/summary/)
4. Currently, the file is manually updated be fetching the numbers from the yearly grant summary file and pasting it in the [overall grant summary CSV](docs/assam-grant-summary-overall.csv)
5. The overall grant summary CSV is then uploaded on the Justice Hub [here](https://justicehub.in/dataset/budgets-for-justice-assam/resource/9760b0ed-3f7a-40d1-8d35-ed8e0e7eed95)
